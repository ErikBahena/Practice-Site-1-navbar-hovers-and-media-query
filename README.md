Hello there to whom it may concern,

This is a simple project, following a tutorial online. Although it is copied, this tutorial helped me
get the ideas on how to tackle solo projecs.
This project has helped me gain practice with html: links, buttons, flexbox, and grid.
Css:media queries and animations, and javascript: dom manipulation.

I personally find the visual appeal to be great and the implemention of javascript to be elegant.
For future projects, I will use this project to think about html structure, and css features.

Hope you enjoy! You can view it at:
